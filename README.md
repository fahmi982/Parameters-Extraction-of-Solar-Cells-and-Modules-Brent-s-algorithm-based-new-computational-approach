# Parameters-Extraction-of-Solar-Cells-and-Modules-Brent's-algorithm
Here is the software application of BA based approach to determine the parameters of solar cells and modules efficiently and easily.
First, install (MATLAB runtime R2017b) on your computer, which can be freely dowloaded from (https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html).
Second, install the proposed BA-based application via .exe file and start running it.
To extrat the devices paramters, IV data should be imported into the app in CSV format (sample attached) while cell temperature and number of series cells are given.
